A Deep Neural Network Sensor for Visual Servoing in 3D Spaces

This work is created and maintaned by Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo and Petar Durdevic at Aalborg University Esbjerg Campus. The files contained in this project are related to the following publication: "A Deep Neural Network Sensor for Visual Servoing in 3D Spaces", which is submitted in the journal of Sensors (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors). After publishing the link to the paper will be released. 

This project contains images used for training of the network used in the paper... (updates will follow shortly)
