A Deep Neural Network Sensor for Visual Servoing in 3D Spaces

This work is created and maintaned by Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo and Petar Durdevic at Aalborg University Esbjerg Campus. The files contained in this project are related to the following publication: "A Deep Neural Network Sensor for Visual Servoing in 3D Spaces", which is submitted in the journal of Sensors (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors). After publishing the link to the paper will be released. 

This project contains images used for training of the network used in the paper... (updates will follow shortly)

These images were collected at Aalborg University Esbjerg Campus, Niels Bohrs Vej 8, 6700 Esbjerg, Denmark
